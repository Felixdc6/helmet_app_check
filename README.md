Project Summary:

This project involved collaborating with a team to develop an application using the YOLOv8 model for detecting whether a person is wearing a helmet. If the person is not wearing a helmet, 
the applications shows the person in red square, and person wears helmet, it shows the person in green square

Key Details:

Model Training: Over 120 hours of training with YOLOv8, achieving 92.90% precision.
Data: 7500 images used; data cleaning involved converting label XML files to YOLO format.
Implementation: Basic application demo available on Streamlit with the source code on GitHub.
The project demonstrates practical application of machine learning for safety compliance with high accuracy.
